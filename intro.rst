Goals and Focus
***************

To have a complete syllabus for training smart persons with high potential who
already have a basic understanding of Linux or other UNIX variant, to become
strong junior systems administrators. This course will focus on the Linux
platform as a basis for competency in any UNIX ecosystem.

Usenix defines the sysadmin role as:

.. epigraph::
   Familiarity with an operating system and its commands/utilities at a user
   level; ability to edit files, use basic utilities and commands, find users'
   home directories, navigate through the file system, install software on
   workstations, and use I/O redirection; some understanding of how user
   authentication happens in a directory service context. Ability to
   identify/locate shared resources and perform simple tasks (e.g., manipulate
   jobs in a print queue, figure out why a network file system isn't
   available).
